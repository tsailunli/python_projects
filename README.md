Hello there,
 
This repository is my programming projects about object-oriented, data structure, and algorithm in class.
 
Watch my [DEMO VIDEOS](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cxHy-ISk9fS147xfG1uUQu6mLmPl1fkx?usp=sharing)!
 
 
 
* [breakout_game](https://github.com/nano19595/stanCode_projects_SC101/tree/main/stanCode_projects_SC101/breakout_game)
  * Breakout is a game that everyone is familiar with and probably has played. It's exciting to write such a classic game by myself!
  * Applying object-oriented concept, I created a Class and set attributes to build bricks, a paddle, and a ball, and to initialize mouse listeners. 
  Then set methods to make the ball and the paddle work properly. 
  * Animation were included in the game as well, such as how to make the ball move and rebound. 
 
 
* [baby_name_ranking_searching_system](https://github.com/nano19595/stanCode_projects_SC101/tree/main/stanCode_projects_SC101/baby_name_ranking_searching_system)
  * Are you curious about whether you name were popular decades ago? Baby name ranking searching system includes top 1000 newborns' names from 1900 to 2010. (Data are from The United States Social Security Administration)
  * Read datd from txt files first and used list and dictionary to store and manipulate data. For visualization, I drew line graph through tkinter.
  * I also did an extension for the ranking system by utilizing web crawling. 
  
  
* [anagram_game](https://github.com/nano19595/stanCode_projects_SC101/tree/main/stanCode_projects_SC101/anagram_game)
  * Have you wondering how many words can be found in a dictionary by rearranging a given word? This anagram game helps you to get answers. For example, there are 6 words that have the same characters as 'stop' in a dictionary.
 
* [boggle_game](https://github.com/nano19595/stanCode_projects_SC101/tree/main/stanCode_projects_SC101/boggle_game)
  * Boggle is a game with 16 characters. By selecting at a random character as starting point, players can combine the character around the chosen one to see if it is possible to form a new word. Keep repeating the process until all characthers have become the starting point.
  
* In addition to file reading and data structures, both anagram and boggle games applied the concept of recursion, backtracking, early stopping, and helper function.
